# Explanation

So this is the old auto mod shield totem of undying that I swapped for one more accurate. If you prefer this one just rename the png file to totem_of_undying and put it in the item folder [assets >> minecraft >> textures >> item] and rename or remove the other totem so the game doesn't mix them up. This one may be greener than the standard totem because I can't tell the difference between green and gold. Whoops. I think it's gold but if you see any green pixels that shouldn't be there, then that's on me.
